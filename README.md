# Google Maps Tools v1.0
------------------------
An ArcGIS python add-in that allows a user to open their current view in Google Maps, or open Street View at a selected location.


## Requirements
---------------
The Python library [pyproj](https://github.com/jswhit/pyproj) is required for this add-in to work correctly.


## Install
----------
To create the add-in clone github repo and run makeaddin.py. Install the resulting .esriaddin file.


## Notes
--------
This *should* work for most coordinate systems. I've tested several different ones with good success.
