# Google Maps Tools v1.0
An ArcGIS python add-in that allows a user to open their current view in Google Maps, or open Street View at a selected location.


## Requirements
The python library [pyproj](https://github.com/jswhit/pyproj) is required for this add-in to work correctly.


## Install
1. Install the [pyproj](https://github.com/jswhit/pyproj) library.
2. Clone the repository
3. Run makeaddin.py. 
4. Install the resulting .esriaddin file.


## Notes
This *should* work for most coordinate systems. I've tested several different ones with good success.
